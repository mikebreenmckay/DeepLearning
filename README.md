# DeepLearning
Exploration of some deep learning models.  A combination of the lightnight AI course at https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/ and my own work. 

- logreg_classifier.ipynb: Simple logistic regression using PyTorch and mock data
- model_checkpointing.ipynb: Test code to utilize model checkpointing
- multilayerNN.ipynb: Multi-layer neural network built with PyTorch
- notes_unit6.md: Some notes from the videos in unit 6 (Deep Learning Tips and Tricks) from the Lightning.ai course listed above.
- perceptron.ipynb: Basic perceptron built with PyTorch
- shared_utilities.py: Common classes and functions for deep learning
  - LightningModel class
  - CustomDataset class
  - CustomDataModule class
  - plot_csv_logger function
- various datasets
  - truncated_toy_data.txt
  - xor.csv
